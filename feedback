Team Name(s):  Robert Pooley and Jeremy Schonfeld

Document and describe any enhancements included to help the judges properly grade your submission.
	We created a GUI that displays a data table of all of the data. This table allows you to sort all of the data.
	
	You can also use the filter options to filter to specific subsets of data by using the selectors at the top.
	
	Finally, you can select your X and Y variables to create a visual graph to represent the data (within the subset of the filters).
	
	This GUI can be launched with any CSV file including the given one.
